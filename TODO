Tawny-Cdk TODO List
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that Tawny CDK is basically a complete copy of Thomas Dickey version of
Mike Glover's CDK it is essentially usable, but there's still a lot to do:

 * Documentation
   - Most of the original comments from the .c files were preserved but many
     of those are less than helpful and some areas where they might be more
     helpful are lacking.  Further, the .h files have a few potentially
     useful comments that were not preserved.  Further, module, class, and
     method docs are either lacking or nonexistent in most places. Tawny CDK
     won't see a major version release until some better docs are in place.
 * Code cleanup
   - This project was how I learned Ruby so there are probably a fair number
     of Ruby conventions being broken all over the place.  This goes double
     since I stayed fairly close to the original C in some places where it
     wasn't necessarily appropriate.
 * Continue restructuring
   - Related to but distinct from the cleanup.  The original C code was a
     very impressive approximation of polymorphic object-oriented code.
     Since Ruby is actually object-oriented I've mostly translated this into
     this paradigm but some work still remains.  Some of the codebase can
     definitely benefit from a more aggressive approach to the object
     orientation and polymorphic behaviour.  Further, I need to take a more
     critical eye at seeing what works better as inherited classes and what
     works better as mixins since apparently those are different things in
     Ruby.
 * Error handling
   - In part to allow for more rapid development and in part because I still
     need to get more familiar with Ruby's exception handling but the code
     is nowhere near as robust as it should be.  In some cases, such as a lot
     of the file handling, this means implementing intelligent rescues.  In
     other cases this means dealing more robustly with sensible but unexpected
     parameter types.
 * Package it all up
   - Tawny CDK won't see a major version release until I work on packaging it
     all up.
 * Compatiblity version
   - Right now I've significantly renamed and restructured a lot of things to
     better facilitate development but have still attempted to remain somewhat
     faithful to the original version.  At some point I'd like to fix this with
     a sort of split: a less faithful 'primary' version that makes more sense
     in Ruby and a as-faithful-as-possible 'compatibility' version that wraps
     the primary version into the same (more-or-less) names and structure as
     the original.
 * Support other Curses packages
   - Right now this is all developed for a very specific Ncurses package.
     Ruby has multiple Curses packages so it would be nice to provide broader
     support.
 * Fixes
   - The code has a few "FIXME(original)" tags strewn around.  Some of these
     appear to be significantly easier to fix in Ruby and might even provide
     some insight to allow me to kick fixes back to Thomas's project.
 * The Cdk TODO List
   - The Dickey/Glover version has its own TODO list with several items that
     would be interesting to add.  As with fixes, some of them may be easier
     to implement in the Ruby version and then use the insights gained to
     kick back to the C.
 * Collections
   - It's simple: a widget that is really a collection of widgets.  Fully take
     advantage of real object-orientation and polymorphism and make a widget
     that collects widgets and handles them as one.  Have its activate really
     activate the focused widget, move affect all widgets in the collection as
     one, and things like that.  Basically, make it really easy to combine
     widgets in useful manners
