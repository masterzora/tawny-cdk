tawny-cdk
========

A Ruby version of Thomas Dickey version of the curses development kit.

Why Tawny?  Because this is better than just a ruby port.  Or, rather, it
will be.  At the moment it's pretty much just a Ruby port but the plan is
a package that is easier to use and extend, with extra extensions to prove
it.

Currently requires ncurses-ruby (http://ncurses-ruby.berlios.de/).

Currently implemented widgets:
 * Alphalist
 * Button
 * Buttonbox
 * Calendar
 * Dialog
 * Entry
 * File Selector
 * Graph
 * Histogram
 * Item List
 * Label
 * Matrix
 * Marquee
 * Menu
 * Multiple Line Entry
 * Radio List
 * Scale
 * Scrolling List
 * Scrolling Window 
 * Selection List
 * Slider
 * Template
 * Viewer
